# Makefiles are fun

As I work on implementing a Turing machine in GNU's Make, I've been making little test files
to work with and so why not put it into a seperate repository from the Turing machine.

The names of the files should be fairly self-explanatory:

* `Args` => experiments with how Make handles arguments
* `Eval` => evaluating expressions at runtime and functional programming
* `Math` => implementing basic arithmetic operations in Make
* `SetupStates` => parse a user input into transition tables (for use with the Turing machine)
* `Strings` => basic string operations
* `WhichAS` => assign the native 'as' installation to its respective variable, keeping the
cross-platform binaries
